        Color scheme: blue (like sky blue or cool water), green (think forest or sage), and white. Could also include
        a nice brown and/or a golden yellow). Make blue accent color, the less used one?

        Use for backgrounds and large areas. Forest green can establish a calming, 
        nature-inspired environment in apps promoting wellness or outdoor activities. Ensure sufficient contrast for
         text readability by testing with a contrast checker. Pair with light neutrals. Complement forest green with
        light neutrals like beige or soft grey to maintain readability and a sense of balance.

        Soft gold (#D4AF37) introduces a touch of luxury,
        creating a harmonious balance with forest green's understated elegance.

        Cream (#FDFBD4) offers a light, neutral backdrop that allows the depth of 
        forest green to stand out, creating a classic and refined palette. -->

    Current Questions:
    Opinions on layout?
 
    Opinions on color? (After you play with it a LOT.) Click on menu and it'll slide up, like music or a music player 
    icon floating around somewhere.
    Ask Vish where to put audio player
    HE SAID A MODAL, MAKE IT FLOAT. 

    If you struggle to figure out where to put "Find Experiences" (bottom near newsletter or section below bottom)
    ask Vish. Will probably have its own separate section before bottom though. Maybe use the world Map for the
    photo of that? Ask him if he thinks that looks good. Could do Horse Legolas, Fishing Spot, or Rohan Throne room??
    Or a picture of tourists from NZ, idk.-->
