This is the official name of this project, although I've casually been calling it *MiddleEarthTravel*.

- this is a small test. Ignore it! 
  - __another wee test. (Mission success)__ 

CHANGES:
Make a Regions section without the map.
The regions of Middle Earth: Misty Mountains Mirkwood Moria Rohan Gondor Orodruin formerly known as Mount Doom, Erebor (the Lonely Mountain), The Shire, 


  Note: Add camping to accomodation, bed and breakfast, Inns, maybe castles and fortresses...

  Note 2.0: Travel tips and accommodation, picture of the eagles for how to get there. How to get around can be more horseback? Or maybe Gandalf and his wagon?

  Note 3.0: 
  Could use BedroomFrodo rather than the current rivendell picture to help the palette.
  Could also make a good accomodation picture.
  If in a pinch can look for big pictures of the mirkwood bridge for the main big picture at 
  the front. Possible same with Rohan throne room, or hall in a pinch.
  Can use fishing for outdoor activities or just like, dwarf throwing image if I really want to hunt.
  Can also sub out legolas with a horse for some sort of activity.
  Incorporate Smeagol Sushi and Shadowfax Stables? Or maybe something about riding in Rohan. 
  Consider a pipeweed smoke shop lol.
  Could incorporate something with mushrooms too, like mushroom foraging or some kind of mushroom
  product or souvenir.
  If adding a cuisine section do make a "meat's back on the menu boys!" joke. Hearty mushrooms
  for even the pickiest vegan and. Maybe incorporate with Smeagol's Sushi, Michelin star restaurant.
  Meat pies in the shire? Rosie's Pie Shop?

  Note 4.0:
  look up free mushroom or toadstool images I can add. Maybe something to add more brown, or to add balance to 
  the palette I officially choose. Could consider similar idea with moss but we will see.

  Note 5.0:
   Ask Vish where to put audio player: HE SAID A MODAL, MAKE IT FLOAT

   Note 6.0:
   Put a mushroom in the footer? If not, a memorable image. Think of how Spain's looked.


   Previously in the comments of the HTML:
   If you struggle to figure out where to put "Find Experiences" (bottom near newsletter or section below bottom)
    ask Vish. Will probably have its own separate section before bottom though. Maybe use the world Map for the
    photo of that? Ask him if he thinks that looks good. Could do Horse Legolas, Fishing Spot, or Rohan Throne room??
    Or a picture of tourists from NZ, idk.
