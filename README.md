To do for lotr:
1. Consider looking for new background image for tree part of site, top part or tint it accordingly to make it look nicer and possibly match the color scheme more.
2. If you keep the leaves figure out a tasteful way to resize the search bar and make it cuter, whether it's adding the ring or adding an acorn because it's in the treetop.
3. Find new fonts. Find one that flatters the title/poster font, you most likely have to give up the one you like that's in Tolkien's writing. Check the ones you already have tabs of or are straight up downloaded and added to lotr.
4. Reconsider font and image sizes especially for the bottom section.
5. Experiment with a tint for the wooden bottom part or use a different picture altogether. Experiment with tinting that as well.
6. Resize Gondor picture. DONE
7. Use fucking flexbox if you haven't and get rid of floats. DONE
8. Consider tinting the cursor to your liking, or at least trying.
9. Consider adding borders or shadows to pictures or boxes of texts.
10. Consider recoloring the icons at the woody bottom that are like castle and stuff
11. If you use an acorn at the top use the ring at the bottom for contact us.
12. Consider changing the color of the runes at the bottom, don't like having it especially white but...
13. Consider changing the color of Middle Earth and the tree symbol, effectively the logo especially if you don't alter the tree leaves much or give things like boxes to make them more visible.
14. ADD TEXT SHADOWS TO MAKE THINGS MORE VISIBLE GOOD LORD (words. The things are words.)
15. Look at your palette and figure out what color you actually want words primarily and whether black and white are truly a part of that.
16. Review the actual content and if the wording is like cheesy. Because reading it now a lad is thinking that may the case, that it may be hammy.
17. Consider a whimsical mushroom in the footer or even that really cute mushroom stump picture you have saved here.
18. Optional but add a modal floating audio player and look for an official Lotr playlist instead of using your own spotify. HALF done
19. Make sure any mushroom images you have match the palette, or note that as you look. If not consider what tinting would be most helpful.
20. Fix the powerpoint slideshow dude????
21. Consider making the mushroom a music player, or putting it inside of an ent. If there's some relevant musical instrument or character to add find a way to incorporate it in.

TOMORROW:
Flex the trending and upcoming events and label actually like what they are.
After flexing format the text accordingly and then experiment with title font.

Then work on how to get around, how to get there, and accomodation formatting. Decide image size during formatting.
Go through history and just save icons with links to the site rather than true saving.
Maybe ask Vish for help on the lines in the footer.

Figure out Smeagol Sushi image. Consider border for picture that's like the hero. Link other images that you'll want as it like, slideshows first.

This is the official name of this project, although I've casually been calling it *MiddleEarthTravel*.

- this is a small test. Ignore it! 
  - __another wee test. (Mission success)__ 

CHANGES:
Make a Regions section without the map.
The regions of Middle Earth: Misty Mountains Mirkwood Moria Rohan Gondor Orodruin formerly known as Mount Doom, Erebor (the Lonely Mountain), The Shire, 


  Note 2.0: Travel tips and accommodation, picture of the eagles for how to get there. How to get around can be more horseback? Or maybe Gandalf and his wagon?

  Note 3.0: 
  Could use BedroomFrodo rather than the current rivendell picture to help the palette.
  Could also make a good accomodation picture.
  If in a pinch can look for big pictures of the mirkwood bridge for the main big picture at 
  the front. Possible same with Rohan throne room, or hall in a pinch.
  Can use fishing for outdoor activities or just like, dwarf throwing image if I really want to hunt.
  Can also sub out legolas with a horse for some sort of activity.
  Incorporate Smeagol Sushi and Shadowfax Stables? Or maybe something about riding in Rohan. 
  Consider a pipeweed smoke shop lol.
  Could incorporate something with mushrooms too, like mushroom foraging or some kind of mushroom
  product or souvenir.
  If adding a cuisine section do make a "meat's back on the menu boys!" joke. Hearty mushrooms
  for even the pickiest vegan and. Maybe incorporate with Smeagol's Sushi, Michelin star restaurant.
  Meat pies in the shire? Rosie's Pie Shop?

  Note 4.0:
  look up free mushroom or toadstool images I can add. Maybe something to add more brown, or to add balance to 
  the palette I officially choose. Could consider similar idea with moss but we will see.


   Previously in the comments of the HTML:
   If you struggle to figure out where to put "Find Experiences" (bottom near newsletter or section below bottom)
    ask Vish. Will probably have its own separate section before bottom though. Maybe use the world Map for the
    photo of that? Ask him if he thinks that looks good. Could do Horse Legolas, Fishing Spot, or Rohan Throne room??
    Or a picture of tourists from NZ, idk.
